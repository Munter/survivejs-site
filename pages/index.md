Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly. Combined with [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands.

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* shows you how to build a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) application based on these technologies as shown below:

Psst. <a href="/demos/08_building_kanban/" target="_blank">You can try out the application online.</a>

By reading this book, you will learn to:

0. Set up a Webpack based development and production environment. You will learn to get most out of [babel-plugin-react-transform](https://github.com/gaearon/babel-plugin-react-transform) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for development.
0. Improve the quality of your code by using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and friends to spot possible mistakes earlier.
0. Get into the React mindset while learning the basics of [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), an implementation of the [Flux Application Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).
0. Style your React application in various emerging ways.
0. Implement drag and drop for your application using [React DnD](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/).

### Leanpub/Amazon exclusives

In addition, if you buy the Leanpub or Amazon version you will get access to exclusive chapters that show you how to:

0. Deal with typing in React.
0. Test your React application in various ways.

By buying the book, you will support my efforts and allow me to develop more content.

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript and Node.js. Plenty of patience is needed as there's a lot to learn. Fortunately you don't have to be alone at your journey.
