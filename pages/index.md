## What will I learn by reading this book?

Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly. Combined with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands.
</p>

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* shows you how to build a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) application based on these technologies. During the process you will learn to:

0. Set up a Webpack based development and production environment. You will learn to get most out of [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for development.
0. Improve the quality of your code by using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and friends to spot possible mistakes earlier.
0. Get into the React mindset while learning the basics of [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), an implementation of [Flux Application Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).
0. Style your React application in various emerging ways.
0. Implement drag and drop for your application using [React DnD](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/).

In addition, if you buy the Leanpub version you will get exclusive chapters that show you how to:

0. Deal with typing in React.
0. Test your React application in various ways.

Even though I would love to have the entire book open, I feel there needs to be a little something to encourage you to support my efforts. At least for now. The better the book does financially, the more I can develop content. I consider that a win-win and I hope you see it that way too.

Please check out [the online version](webpack_react/introduction) of the book to get started! The book source is available through [GitHub](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react).

The book is freely available under [CC BY-NC-ND](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/) license. You can support creation of new content by [purchasing a digital copy of the book](https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack).

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript and Node.js. Patience is a virtue. You can reach me personally through various ways. [gitter](https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack_react) works well.

This is the most useful book I’ve read this year. Apart from React itself it gives you a headstart into Webpack which is gaining traction as the weapon of choice for deploying Javascript apps and Flux architecture pattern. Well-written, full of annotated code, what’s not to like? Yes, I would recommend it to a friend.

SurviveJS connects the dots and fills the gaps left by the latest JavaScript tools and their documentation.  With its detailed step-by-step tutorial approach, SurviveJS gives practical examples of code and configuration while providing context for choosing one method over another.  As the state of JavaScript tools, frameworks, and libraries rapidly evolves, SurviveJS does exactly what its title implies: helps the developer survive JavaScript.

The author of SurviveJS, Juho Vepsäläinen, is a seasoned professional web application developer.  He has built a growing ecosystem around the book, including an open source repository on GitHub, an online chat room, and frequent updates to the book.

Webpack is powerful but configuring it can be painful. Same goes with React. There are so many ways of configuring React with asset compilation, minification etc that it is easy to get lost. This book provides practical tips on how to get configure Webpack to make it work with React and other modern JavaScript tools like Babel.
