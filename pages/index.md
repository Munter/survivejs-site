## What will I learn by reading this book?

Facebook's [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) powers an increasing amount of sites. There is a good reason for this. It simplifies frontend development greatly. Combined with [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), a bundling tool, you have a powerful frontend development environment in your hands.
</p>

*SurviveJS - Webpack and React* shows you how to build a simple [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29) application based on these technologies. During the process you will learn to:

0. Set up a Webpack based development and production environment. You will learn to get most out of [react-hot-loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for development.
0. Improve the quality of your code by using [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) and friends to spot possible mistakes earlier.
0. Get into the React mindset while learning the basics of [Alt](http://alt.js.org/), an implementation of [Flux Application Architecture](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html).
0. Style your React application in various emerging ways.
0. Implement drag and drop for your application using [React DnD](https://gaearon.github.io/react-dnd/).

I expect you know the basics of JavaScript and Node.js. Patience is a virtue. You can reach me personally through various ways. [gitter](https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack_react) works well.

## Testimonials

### [Nick Ostrovsky](http://firedev.com/)

This is the most useful book I’ve read this year. Apart from React itself it gives you a headstart into Webpack which is gaining traction as the weapon of choice for deploying Javascript apps and Flux architecture pattern. Well-written, full of annotated code, what’s not to like? Yes, I would recommend it to a friend.

### [Steve Piercy](http://www.StevePiercy.com)

SurviveJS connects the dots and fills the gaps left by the latest JavaScript tools and their documentation.  With its detailed step-by-step tutorial approach, SurviveJS gives practical examples of code and configuration while providing context for choosing one method over another.  As the state of JavaScript tools, frameworks, and libraries rapidly evolves, SurviveJS does exactly what its title implies: helps the developer survive JavaScript.

The author of SurviveJS, Juho Vepsäläinen, is a seasoned professional web application developer.  He has built a growing ecosystem around the book, including an open source repository on GitHub, an online chat room, and frequent updates to the book.

### Kevin Duffey

I came across SurviveJS while chatting in a gitter channel that the author, Juho, frequents. I had dabbled in ReactJS over a year earlier and since then a lot has changed, including the Flux (and it's derivatives) framework, and React's own Webpack build tool.

I am still relatively new to functional JS so trying to look at Webpack and some examples online didn't make much sense to me, so when I asked in the gitter channel, Juho responded and helped me, but also told me about his SurviveJS book in the works.

I started with the free bit and it was written so well I decided to buy the book. I will single handedly credit Juho's SurviveJS with rekindling my love of ReactJS and getting me back to developing with it in a matter of hours.

To top it off Juho has been very good on replying to emails and even adding new content per requests. SurviveJS is well worth the price of admission. You get a whopping lot of information, support from Juho and even the chance to contribute and shape the book and future content!
