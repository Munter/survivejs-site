Frontend development moves forward fast. The main purpose of this book is to help you to get up to speed with two emerging tools: webpack and React. Combined these tools allow you to build all sorts of web applications swiftly. Knowledge of webpack is useful beyond React. And understanding React wi…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="webpack_compared">Webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
To understand webpack, it will help to look at the history. That will put the tool in context and show you why the approach is powerful. Back in the day we were happy just to concat some scripts together but that won&#x27;t do anymore. JavaScript libraries can be very large these days and nobody likes t…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="developing_with_webpack">Developing with webpack</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/02_developing_with_webpack" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
If you are not one of those guys that likes to skip introductions, you might have some clue what webpack is. In its simplicity it is a module bundler. It takes a bunch of assets in and outputs assets you can give to your client.

This sounds very simple but in practice it can be a very complicated …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="webpack_and_react">Webpack and React</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/03_webpack_and_react" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Combined with webpack React becomes a joy to work with. Even though you can use React with other build tools, webpack is a good fit and quite straightforward to set up. In this chapter we&#x27;ll expand our configuration so that we have a good starting point for developing our application further.

Given we have a nice development setup now, we can actually get some work done. Our goal here is to end up with a crude note taking application with basic manipulation operations. We will start by doing things the hard way. We will grow our application from scratch and get into some trouble. After …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="react_and_flux">React and Flux</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/05_react_and_flux" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
You can get quite far by keeping everything in components but eventually that will become painful. Flux application architecture was designed to help bring clarity to our React applications.

So far we have managed to set up a nice little development environment and develop an application for keeping track of notes in localStorage. We still have work to do in order to turn this into a real Kanban as pictured above.

Most importantly our system is missing the concept of Lane. A Lane is …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="implementing_dnd">Implementing Drag and Drop</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/07_implementing_dnd" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Our Kanban application is almost usable now. It doesn&#x27;t look that bad and there&#x27;s some basic functionality in place. In this chapter I&#x27;ll show you how to take it to the next level. We will integrate some drag and drop functionality as we set up React DnD. After this chapter you should be able to so…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="building_kanban">Building Kanban</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/08_building_kanban" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Now that we have a nice Kanban application up and running we can worry about showing it the public. If you hit TARGET=dev node_modules/.bin/webpack at the project root, you can get a standalone bundle like this:

Nothing is easier than making mistakes when coding in JavaScript. Linting is one of those techniques that can help you to make less mistakes and spot issues before they become actual problems.

Perhaps the most known linter that started it all for JavaScript is Douglas Crockford&#x27;s JSLint. It is opi…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="link" href="deploying_applications">Deploying Applications</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
If you were developing a native application you would probably bundle everything into one file and deploy it to some application store. Size probably wouldn&#x27;t matter that much. Web is different. You can get quite far with a single bundle but at a certain point that becomes unwieldy.

npm is one of the reasons behind the popularity of Node.js. It has become the package manager for JavaScript. Although initially it was used mostly for managing backend packages, it has become increasingly popular in frontend development.

Traditionally web pages have been split up in markup (e.g. HTML), styling (e.g. CSS) and logic (e.g. JavaScript). Even though this sounds simple in practice there are overlaps. You might trigger CSS animations through JavaScript.

As it is possible you&#x27;ll run into problems during development I&#x27;ve tried to cover some common issues here.
