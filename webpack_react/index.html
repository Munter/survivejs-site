Front-end development moves forward fast. In this book we&#x27;ll discuss  Webpack and React. Combined, these tools allow you to build all sorts of web applications swiftly. Knowledge of Webpack is useful beyond React. Understanding React will allow you to see the alternatives in a different light.

Webpack is a powerful module bundler. It hides a lot of power behind configuration. Once you understand its fundamentals, it becomes much easier to use this power. Initially it can be a confusing tool to adopt, but once you break the ice it gets better.

In this part we will develop a Webpack based…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/webpack_compared">Webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
You can understand Webpack better by putting it into an historical context. This will show you why its approach is powerful. Back in the day it was enough just to concatenate some scripts together. Times have changed, though. Now distributing your JavaScript code can be a complex endeavor.

If you are not one of those people who likes to skip the introductions, you might have some clue what Webpack is. In its simplicity, it is a module bundler. It takes a bunch of assets in and outputs assets you can give to your client.

This sounds simple, but in practice, it can be a complicated an…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/webpack_and_react">Webpack and React</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/03_webpack_and_react" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Combined with Webpack React becomes a joy to work with. Even though you can use React with other build tools, Webpack is a good fit and quite straightforward to set up. In this chapter we&#x27;ll expand our configuration. After that we have a good starting point for developing our application further.

React, even though a young library, has made a significant impact on the front-end development community. It introduced concepts such as virtual DOM and made the community understand the power of components. Its component oriented design approach works well for web and other domains.

Given we have a nice development setup now, we can actually get some work done. Our goal here is to end up with a crude note taking application. It will have basic manipulation operations.

You can get pretty far by keeping everything in components. Eventually that will become painful. Flux application architecture helps to bring clarity to our React applications.

So far we have managed to set up a nice little development environment. We have developed an application for keeping track of notes in localStorage`. We still have work to do to turn this into a real Kanban as pictured above. Most importantly our system is missing the concept of `Lane.

Our Kanban application is almost usable now. It looks alright and there&#x27;s some basic functionality in place. In this chapter I&#x27;ll show you how to take it to the next level. We will integrate some drag and drop functionality as we set up React DnD.

Traditionally web pages have been split up into markup (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript). Thanks to React and similar approaches, we&#x27;ve begun to question this split. We still may want to separate our concerns. The separation will happen on a different level instead.
