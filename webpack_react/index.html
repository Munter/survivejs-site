I&#x27;ve tried to cover some common issues here. This chapter will be expanded as common issues are found.

If you have used languages such as Java or Python before, you might be familiar with the idea. Decorators are syntactic sugar that allow us to wrap and annotate classes and functions. In their current proposal (stage 1) only class and method level wrapping is supported. Functions may become support…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/language_features">Language Features</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
ES6 (or ES2015) was arguably the biggest change to JavaScript in a long time. As a result, we received a wide variety of new functionality. The purpose of this appendix is to illustrate the features used in the book in isolation to make it clearer to understand how they work. Rather than going thro…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/structuring_react_projects">Structuring React Projects</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
React doesn&#x27;t enforce any particular project structure. The good thing about this is that it allows you to make up a structure to suit your needs. The bad thing is that it is not possible to provide you an ideal structure that would work for every project. Instead, I&#x27;m going to give you some inspir…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/appendices">Appendices</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
As not everything that&#x27;s worth discussing fits a book like this, I&#x27;ve compiled related material into brief appendices. These support the main material and explain certain topics, such as language features, in greater detail. There are also troubleshooting tips in the end.

Traditionally, web pages have been split up into markup (HTML), styling (CSS), and logic (JavaScript). Thanks to React and similar approaches, we&#x27;ve begun to question this split. We still may want to separate our concerns somehow. But the split can be different.

This change in the mindset has lead…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/authoring_libraries">Authoring Libraries</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
npm is one of the reasons behind the popularity of Node.js. Even though it was used initially for managing back-end packages, it has become increasingly popular for front-end usage as well. As you saw in the earlier chapters, it is easy to consume npm packages through Webpack.

Eventually, you may …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/linting_in_webpack">Linting in Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Nothing is easier than making mistakes when coding in JavaScript. Linting is one of those techniques that can help you to make less mistakes. You can spot issues before they become actual problems.

Better yet, modern editors and IDEs offer strong support for popular tools. This means you can spot …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/typing_with_react">Typing with React*</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

There are a variety of advanced Webpack and React techniques that are good to be aware of. Linting can improve the quality of your code as it allows you to spot potential issues earlier. We will also discuss various ways you can use Webpack to bundle your application.

Besides consuming libraries, …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/building_kanban">Building Kanban</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/08_building_kanban" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Now that we have a nice Kanban application up and running, we can worry about showing it to the public. The goal of this chapter is to set up a nice production grade build. There are various techniques we can apply to bring the bundle size down. We can also leverage browser caching.

Our Kanban application is almost usable now. It looks alright and there&#x27;s some basic functionality in place. In this chapter, I&#x27;ll show you how to take it to the next level. We will integrate some drag and drop functionality as we set up React DnD. After this chapter, you should be able to sort not…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/from_notes_to_kanban">From Notes to Kanban</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/06_from_notes_to_kanban" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">

So far, we have managed to set up a nice little development environment. We have developed an application for keeping track of notes in localStorage. We still have work to do to turn this into a real Kanban as pictured above. Most importantly our system is missing the concept of Lane.

You can get pretty far by keeping everything in components. Eventually, that will become painful. Flux application architecture helps to bring clarity to our React applications.

Flux will allow us to separate data and application state from our views. This helps us to keep them clean and the appli…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/implementing_notes">Implementing a Basic Note Application</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/04_implementing_notes" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Given we have a nice development setup now, we can actually get some work done. Our goal here is to end up with a crude note-taking application. It will have basic manipulation operations. We will grow our application from scratch and get into some trouble.

React, even though a young library, has made a significant impact on the front-end development community. It introduced concepts, such as the virtual DOM, and made the community understand the power of components. Its component oriented design approach works well for the web. But React isn&#x27;t limite…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/webpack_and_react">Webpack and React</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/03_webpack_and_react" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
Combined with Webpack, React becomes a joy to work with. Even though you can use React with other build tools, Webpack is a good fit and quite straightforward to set up. In this chapter, we&#x27;ll expand our configuration. After that, we have a good starting point for developing our application further…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack">Developing with Webpack</a></h3><div class="post-list__demo"><a href="/demos/02_developing_with_webpack" target="_blank">Demo</a></div><p class="post-list__preview">
If you are not one of those people who likes to skip the introductions, you might have some clue what Webpack is. In its simplicity, it is a module bundler. It takes a bunch of assets in and outputs assets you can give to your client.

This sounds simple, but in practice, it can be a complicated an…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/webpack_compared">Webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
You can understand better why Webpack&#x27;s approach is powerful by putting it into historical context. Back in the day, it was enough just to concatenate some scripts together. Times have changed, though, and now distributing your JavaScript code can be a complex endeavor.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/webpack">Setting Up Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack is a powerful module bundler. It hides a lot of power behind configuration. Once you understand its fundamentals, it becomes much easier to use this power. Initially, it can be a confusing tool to adopt, but once you break the ice, it gets better.

In this part, we will develop a Webpack ba…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack_react/introduction">Introduction</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Front-end development moves forward fast. A good indication of this is the pace in which new technologies appear to the scene. Webpack and React are two recent newcomers. Combined, these tools allow you to build all sorts of web applications swiftly.
