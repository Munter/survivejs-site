<blockquote class="tip">Common editors (Sublime Text, Visual Studio Code, vim, emacs, Atom and such) have good support for React. Even IDEs such as <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/">WebStorm</a> support it up to an extent. <a href="http://nuclide.io/">Nuclide</a>, an Atom based IDE, has been developed with React in mind.</blockquote><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-react-" id="what-is-react-"></a><h2>What is React?<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#what-is-react-">#</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/react_header.png" alt="React"></p>
<p>Facebook&apos;s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> has changed the way we think about front-end development. Also, thanks to <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">React Native</a> the approach isn&apos;t limited just to web. Although simple to learn, React provides plenty of power.</p>
<p>React isn&apos;t a framework like Angular.js or Ember. Frameworks tend to provide a lot of solutions out of the box. With React you will have to assemble your application from separate libraries. Both approaches have their merits. Frameworks may be faster to pick up, but they can become harder to work with as you hit their boundaries. In a library based approach you have more flexibility, but also responsibility.</p>
<p>React introduced a concept known as virtual DOM to web developers. React maintains a DOM of its own unlike all the libraries and frameworks before it. As changes are made to virtual DOM, React will batch the changes to the actual DOM as it sees best.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">Libraries such as <a href="https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom">Matt-Esch/virtual-dom</a> focus entirely on Virtual DOM. If you are interested in the theory, check it out.</blockquote><a class="header-anchor" href="#jsx-and-virtual-dom" id="jsx-and-virtual-dom"></a><h3>JSX and Virtual DOM<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#jsx-and-virtual-dom">#</a></h3>
<p>React provides a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/top-level-api.html">high level API</a> for generating virtual DOM. Generating complex structures using the API becomes cumbersome fast. Thus people usually don&apos;t write it by hand. Instead, they use some intermediate format that is converted into it. Facebook&apos;s <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jsx/">JSX</a> is one popular format.</p>
<p>JSX is a superset of JavaScript that allows you to mix XMLish syntax with JavaScript. Consider the example below:</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedjavascript">function render() {
  const names = [&apos;John&apos;, &apos;Jill&apos;, &apos;Jack&apos;];

  return (
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">h2</span>&gt;</span>Names<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">h2</span>&gt;</span>

      <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">ul</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">className</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&apos;names&apos;</span>&gt;</span>{
        names.map((name) =&gt;
          <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-title">li</span> <span class="hljs-attribute">className</span>=<span class="hljs-value">&apos;name&apos;</span>&gt;</span>{name}<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">li</span>&gt;</span>
        )
      }<span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">ul</span>&gt;</span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-title">div</span>&gt;</span>
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you haven&apos;t seen JSX before it will likely look strange. It isn&apos;t uncommon to experience &quot;JSX shock&quot; until you start to understand it. After that it all makes sense.</p>
<p>Cory House goes into more detail <a href="https://medium.com/@housecor/react-s-jsx-the-other-side-of-the-coin-2ace7ab62b98">about the shock</a>. Briefly summarized, JSX gives us a level of validation we haven&apos;t encountered earlier. It takes a while to grasp but once you get it, it&apos;s hard to go back.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">Note that <code>render()</code> <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/tips/maximum-number-of-jsx-root-nodes.html">must return a single node</a>. Returning multiple won&apos;t work!</blockquote><p>In JSX we are mixing something that looks a bit like HTML with JavaScript. Note how we treat attributes. Instead of using <code>class</code> as we would in vanilla HTML, we use <code>className</code>, which is the DOM equivalent. Even though JSX will feel a little weird to use at first, it will become second nature over time.</p>
<p>The developers of React have decoupled themselves from the limitations of the DOM. As a result, React is highly performant. This comes with a cost, though. The library isn&apos;t as small as you might expect. You can expect bundle sizes for small applications to be around 150-200k, React included. That is considerably less when gzipped over the wire, but it&apos;s still something.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">The interesting side benefit of this approach is that React doesn&apos;t depend on the DOM. In fact, React can use other targets, such as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">mobile</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Flipboard/react-canvas">canvas</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed">terminal</a>. The DOM just happens to be the most relevant one for web developers.</blockquote><a class="header-anchor" href="#better-with-friends" id="better-with-friends"></a><h3>Better with Friends<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#better-with-friends">#</a></h3>
<p>React isn&apos;t the smallest library out there. It does manage to solve fundamental problems, though. It is a pleasure to develop thanks to its relative simplicity and a powerful API. You will need to complement it with a set of tools, but you can pick these based on actual need. It&apos;s far from a &quot;one size fits all&quot; type of solution which frameworks tend to be.</p>
<p>The approach used by React allowed Facebook to develop React Native on top of the same ideas. This time instead of the DOM, we are operating on mobile platform rendering. React Native provides abstraction over components and a layout system. It provides you the setup you already know from the web. This makes it a good gateway for web developers wanting to go mobile.</p>
<a class="header-anchor" href="#babel" id="babel"></a><h2>Babel<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#babel">#</a></h2>
<p><img src="/images/babel.png" alt="Babel"></p>
<p><a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a> has made a big impact on the community. It allows us to use features from the future of JavaScript. It will transform your futuristic code to a format browsers understand. You can even use it to develop your own language features. Babel&apos;s built-in JSX support will come in handy here.</p>
<p>Babel provides support for certain <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/experimental/">experimental features</a> from ES7 beyond standard ES6. Some of these might make it to the core language while some might be dropped altogether. The language proposals have been categorized within stages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Stage 0</strong> - Strawman</li>
<li><strong>Stage 1</strong> - Proposal</li>
<li><strong>Stage 2</strong> - Draft - Features starting from <em>stage 2</em> have been enabled by default</li>
<li><strong>Stage 3</strong> - Candidate</li>
<li><strong>Stage 4</strong> - Finished</li>
</ul>
<p>I would be careful with <strong>stage 0</strong> features. The problem is that if the feature changes or gets removed you will end up with broken code and will need to rewrite it. In smaller experimental projects it may be worth the risk. In our project we&apos;ll enable <strong>stage 1</strong>. This allows us to use decorators and property spreading. These features will make our code a little tidier.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">You can <a href="https://babeljs.io/repl/">try out Babel online</a> to see what kind of code it generates.</blockquote><a class="header-anchor" href="#configuring-babel-loader-" id="configuring-babel-loader-"></a><h3>Configuring <code>babel-loader</code><a class="header-anchor-select" href="#configuring-babel-loader-">#</a></h3>
<p>You can use Babel with Webpack easily through <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader">babel-loader</a>. It takes our ES6 module definition based code and turn it into ES5 bundles. Install <em>babel-loader</em> with</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedbash">npm i babel-core babel-loader --save-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Besides, we need to add a loader declaration to the <em>loaders</em> section of configuration. It matches against <code>.js</code> and <code>.jsx</code> using a regular expression (<code>/\.jsx?$/</code>).</p>
<p>To keep everything performant we restrict the loader to operate within <code>./app</code> directory. This way it won&apos;t traverse <code>node_modules</code>. An alternative would be to set up an <code>exclude</code> rule against <code>node_modules</code> explicitly. I find it more useful to <code>include</code> instead as that&apos;s more explicit. You never know what files might be in the structure after all.</p>
<p>Here&apos;s the relevant configuration we need to make Babel work:</p>
<p><strong>webpack.config.js</strong></p>
<pre><code class="undefinedjavascript">...

<span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> common = {
  entry: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, <span class="hljs-string">&apos;app&apos;</span>),
  resolve: {
    extensions: [<span class="hljs-string">&apos;&apos;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&apos;.js&apos;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&apos;.jsx&apos;</span>]
  },
  ...
};

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span>(TARGET === <span class="hljs-string">&apos;start&apos;</span> || !TARGET) {
  <span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>.exports = merge(common, {
    devtool: <span class="hljs-string">&apos;eval-source-map&apos;</span>,
    <span class="hljs-built_in">module</span>: {
      loaders: [
        {
          test: <span class="hljs-regexp">/\.jsx?$/</span>,
          loaders: [<span class="hljs-string">&apos;babel&apos;</span>],
          include: path.resolve(ROOT_PATH, <span class="hljs-string">&apos;app&apos;</span>)
        }
      ]
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>resolve.extensions</code> setting will allow you to refer to JSX files without an extension now. I&apos;ll be using the extension for clarity but now you can omit it if you want to.</p>
<blockquote class="tip">As <code>resolve.extensions</code> gets evaluated from left to right, we can use it to control which code gets loaded for given configuration. For instance, you could have <code>.web.js</code> to define web specific parts and then have something like <code>[&apos;&apos;, &apos;.web.js&apos;, &apos;.js&apos;, &apos;.jsx&apos;]</code>. If a &quot;web&quot; version of the file is found, Webpack would use that instead of the default.</blockquote><p>Also, we are going to need a <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/">.babelrc</a>. You could pass Babel settings through Webpack (i.e. <code>babel?stage=1</code>), but then it would be just for Webpack only. That&apos;s why we are going to push our Babel settings to this specific dotfile. The same idea applies for other tools such as ESLint.</p>
<p><strong>.babelrc</strong></p>
<pre><code class="undefinedjson">{
  &quot;<span class="hljs-attribute">stage</span>&quot;: <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">1</span>
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>There are other possible <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/">.babelrc options</a>. Now we are just keeping it simple. You could, for instance, enable the features you want to use explicitly.</p>
<a class="header-anchor" href="#advanced-babel-setup" id="advanced-babel-setup"></a><h3>Advanced Babel Setup<a class="header-anchor-select" href="#advanced-babel-setup">#</a></h3>
<p>Babel is a powerful tool. You can even use it to process your Webpack configuration. We won&apos;t be doing this yet but it&apos;s a good technique to be aware of.</p>
<p>First you will need to make sure Babel is included into your project as a dependency. After that you can rename your <code>webpack.config.js</code> as <code>webpack.config.babel.js</code>. Webpack will process configuration through Babel after that. It picks up <code>.babelrc</code> settings.</p>
<p>Sometimes you might want to perform advanced Babel configuration. Currently Babel allows you to control <code>.babelrc</code> through env. To quote <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/babelrc/">the documentation</a>, you could do something like this:</p>
<p><strong>.babelrc</strong></p>
<pre><code class="undefinedjson">{
  &quot;<span class="hljs-attribute">stage</span>&quot;: <span class="hljs-value"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span>,
  &quot;<span class="hljs-attribute">env</span>&quot;: <span class="hljs-value">{
    &quot;<span class="hljs-attribute">build</span>&quot;: <span class="hljs-value">{
      &quot;<span class="hljs-attribute">optional</span>&quot;: <span class="hljs-value">[<span class="hljs-string">&quot;optimisation&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;minification&quot;</span>]
    </span>}
  </span>}
</span>}
</code></pre>
<p>This would enable production build specific Babel optimizations. You have to check out the official documentation for exact flags to use. Some may be considered experimental and might be better avoided for now.</p>
<p>Doing the aforementioned configuration isn&apos;t enough. Babel determines <code>env</code> like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use the value of <code>BABEL_ENV</code> if set</li>
<li>Use the value of <code>NODE_ENV</code> if set</li>
<li>Default to <code>development</code></li>
</ol>
<p>In this case we could set <code>BABEL_ENV</code> based on npm lifecycle event given we&apos;re triggering it through npm. The following line would work:</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedjavascript">process.env.BABEL_ENV = process.env.npm_lifecycle_event;
</code></pre>
<p>This setup provides you more control over Babel&apos;s behavior depending on the environment.</p>

<p>It is time to add a first application level dependency to our project. Hit</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedbash">npm i react --save
</code></pre>
<p>to get React installed. This will save React to <code>dependencies</code> section of <code>package.json</code>. Later on we&apos;ll use this to generate a vendor build for the production version. It&apos;s a good practice to separate application and development level dependencies this way.</p>
<p>Now that we got that out of the way, we can start to develop our Kanban application. First we should define the <code>App</code>. This will be the core of our application. It represents the high level view of our app and works as an entry point. Later on it will orchestrate the entire app.</p>

<p>Note that every time you perform a modification, the browser updates with a flash. That&apos;s unfortunate because this means our application loses state. It doesn&apos;t matter yet, but as we keep on expanding the application this will become painful. It is annoying to manipulate the user interface back to the state in which it was to test something.</p>
<p>We can work around this problem using hot loading. This is enabled by <a href="https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/">react-hot-loader</a>. It will swap React components one by one as they change without forcing a full refresh. There will be times when that will be necessary, but it will help a lot. Once you get used to hot loading, it is hard to live without.</p>
<p>To enable hot loading for React, you should first install the package using</p>
<pre><code class="undefinedbash">npm i react-hot-loader --save-dev

<p>We also need to make our configuration aware of it so it can inject hooks Webpack requires for the system to work.</p>

Yet, you can use a helper such as <a href="https://github.com/brigand/react-mixin">react-mixin</a>. In later chapters we will go through various alternative approaches. They allow you to reach roughly equivalent results as you can achieve with mixins. Often a decorator is all you need.</p>
<p>Also, ES6 class based components won&apos;t bind their methods to <code>this</code> context by default. This is the reason why it&apos;s good practice to bind the context at the component constructor. We will use this convention in this book. It leads to some extra code, but later on it is likely possible to refactor it out.</p>
<p>The class based approach decreases the amount of concepts you have to worry about. <code>constructor</code> helps to keep things simpler than in <code>React.createClass</code> based approach. There you need to define separate methods to achieve the same result.</p>
<p>In the future property initializers (likely <code>tick = () =&gt; { ... }</code>) will solve this neatly. The proposed feature is available through Babel&apos;s <strong>stage 0</strong>. Enabling that may lead to other problems later on in case the features change.</p>

<p>You should understand how to set up React with Webpack now. Hot loading is one of those features that sets Webpack apart. Now that we have a good development environment, we can focus on React development. In the next chapter you will see how to implement a little note taking application. That will be improved in the subsequent chapters into a full blown Kanban table.</p>
