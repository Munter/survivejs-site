Of course it was up to me to do most of the work. That said it is always amazing to get external contributions. It always makes my day when I get one.</p>
<p>I have to give my biggest thanks to <a href="https://github.com/Foxandxss">Jes&#xFA;s Rodr&#xED;guez Rodr&#xED;guez</a>, my new official editor! It&apos;s not understatement to say that he motivated most of the changes you see in the current revision.</p>
<h2 id="book-improvements">Book Improvements</h2>
<p>The book has been improved in various important ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The early part of the book gets faster to the interesting parts (i.e. React). I removed some of the fluff (Flow, redundant <code>index.html</code> etc.) and eliminated the old <code>Getting Started</code> chapter. Now you jump straight to <a href="/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack">developing with webpack</a>.</li>
<li>There&apos;s a new chapter about <a href="/webpack_react/building_kanban">building the Kanban project</a>. I focus on production related concerns there solely and discuss various related techniques. I believe some of those might be useful even if you don&apos;t care about the project itself.</li>
<li>The architecture of the Kanban application has been revamped to be singleton based. This is more faithful to the way <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html">Flux architecture</a> has been designed to use. There are some parts of code that aren&apos;t particularly beautiful and there&apos;s likely some room for improvement.</li>
<li>More insightful explanations. Instead of dropping some code and waiting you to decipher it I&apos;ve moved to <strong>explain</strong>, <strong>show code</strong>, <strong>what happened</strong> kind of model that should be hopefully easier to follow.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition there are hundreds of other fixes. But you know me, I don&apos;t like to ramble too much. You can see GitHub for <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v1.1.0...v1.5.0">all changes</a>.</p>
<h2 id="known-issues">Known Issues</h2>
<p>The portions dealing with Alt don&apos;t support hot loading yet. I will have to craft a pull request to fix <a href="https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/issues/408">a hot loading issue</a>. Doing that should improve your experience a bit. So be prepared to refresh the old fashioned way for now.</p>
<h2 id="what-next-">What Next?</h2>
<p>I will prioritize my work depending on the feedback this release receives. I know some of the current content can be pushed further. For instance <a href="/webpack_react/deploying_applications">deployment chapter</a> could use some TLC. On the other hand it would be a good idea to start serving my paying clients (i.e. Leanpub readers) better.</p>
<p>Given I want to provide the guys that support me a little extra something I&apos;ve thought of making <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22bonus+chapter%22">bonus chapters</a> available on early access through Leanpub. The chapters would become available to public as certain conditions are met.</p>
<p>In order to encourage you to encourage me I could tie it to amount of readers. There are two hundred readers right now. I could release a new chapter as another two hundred are gained for instance until I run out of chapters to write. I believe this would be a fair way to deal with it.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoy this release. There&apos;s a lot of content to go through. As usual <a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues">feedback</a> and pull requests are welcome. I hope you enjoy the improved version of the book.</p>
<p>Remember that you can support my work by <a href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react">purchasing the book at Leanpub</a>. Every little bit counts and allows me to keep it up.</p>
