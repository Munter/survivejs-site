The purpose of this cookbook is to guide you into the world of Webpack. Both are powerful technologies and when used together, frontend development becomes a joy.

The cookbook should have something to offer for all skill levels. If you are interested in just React, skip the Webpack part and vice v…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/basics_of_webpack">Basics of Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

In web development we deal with a lot of small technical artifacts. You use HTML to describe page structure, CSS how to style it and JavaScript for logic. Or you can replace HTML with something like Jade, CSS with Sass or LESS, JavaScript with CoffeeScript, TypeScript and the ilk. In addition you h…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/getting_started">Getting Started</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
&gt; Before getting started you should make sure you have a recent version of Node.js and NPM installed. See nodejs.org for installation details. We&#x27;ll use NPM to set up various tools.

Getting started with Webpack is straightforward. I&#x27;ll show you how to set up a simple project based on it. As a firs…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/running_a_workflow">Running a Workflow</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Hitting npm run build all the time will get boring eventually. Fortunately we can work around that quite easily. Let&#x27;s set up webpack-dev-server.

When webpack-dev-server is running it will watch your files for changes. When that happens it rebundles your project and notifies browsers listening to refresh. To trigger this behavior you need to change your index.html file in the build/ folder.

Webpack allows you to refer to files in various ways.

This part covers basic tasks related to CSS, fonts, and images.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading_css">Loading CSS</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack allows you to load CSS like you load any other code. What strategy you choose is up to you, but you can do everything from loading all your css in the main entry point file to one css file for each component.

Loading CSS requires the css-loader and the style-loader. They have two different…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading_less_or_sass">Loading LESS or SASS</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
If you want to use compiled CSS, there are two loaders available for you. The less-loader and the sass-loader. Depending on your preference, this is how you set it up.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading_stylus_and_yeticss">Loading Stylus and YETICSS</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Another css extension is the stylus-loader. A great complement to this is yeticss a lightweight, modular pattern library written in stylus.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading_images">Loading Images</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Until HTTP/2 is here you want to avoid setting up too many HTTP requests when your application is loading. Depending on the browser you have a set number of requests that can run in parallel. If you load a lot of images in your CSS it is possible to automatically inline these images as BASE64 strin…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading_svg">Loading SVG</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack has a few ways to load SVG. However the simplest way is through file-loader.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading_fonts">Loading Fonts</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Fonts can be really difficult to get right. First of all we have typically 4 different formats, but only one of them will be used by the respective browser. You do not want to inline all 4 formats, as that will just bloat your CSS file and in no way be an optimization.

There are two things you want to do preparing for a production build.

Lets have a look at the simplest setup you can create for your application. Use a single bundle when:

You have a small application
You will rarely update the application
You are not too concerned about perceived initial loading time

When your application is depending on other libraries, especially large ones like React JS, you should consider splitting those dependencies into its own vendors bundle. This will allow you to do updates to your application, without requiring the users to download the vendors bundle again. Use this…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/chunking_in_webpack">Chunking in Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

Maybe you are building an application that has multiple urls. An example of this would be a solution where you have two, or more, different URLs responding with different pages. Maybe you have one user page and one admin page. They both share a lot of code, but you do not want to load all the admin…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/lazy_loaded_entry_points">Lazy Loaded Entry Points</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
It is also possible to lazy load entry points. This means that you load parts of your application as they are requested. A typical scenario for this would be that your users only visits specific parts of the application. And an example of that would be twitter.com. You do not always visit your prof…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/advanced_techniques">Advanced Techniques</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

Webpack can be handy for packaging your library for general consumption. You can use it to output UMD, a format that&#x27;s compatible with various module loaders (CommonJS, AMD) and globals.

Let&#x27;s say we want a custom Markdown loader. Ie. we would like to do something like var readme = require(&#x27;../README.md&#x27;); at our JavaScript file and inject some Markdown converted as HTML there.

As it happens doing something like this is quite easy with Webpack. We&#x27;ll need to implement a little loa…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/optimization_techniques">Optimization Techniques</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

We talked about how you could use the minified versions of your dependencies in development to make the rebundling go as fast as possible. Let us look at a small helper you can implement to make this a bit easier to handle.

When users hit the URL of your application they will need to download different assets. CSS, JavaScript, HTML, images and fonts. The great thing about Webpack is that you can stop thinking how you should download all these assets. You can do it through JavaScript.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/optimizing_rebundling">Optimizing Rebundling</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
You might notice after requiring React JS into your project that the time it takes from a save to a finished rebundle of your application takes more time. In development you ideally want 200-800 ms rebundle speed, depending on what part of the application you are working on.

&gt; IMPORTANT! This setu…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/react_techniques">React Techniques</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/configuring_react">Configuring React</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
npm install react react-dom --save

There is really nothing more to it. You can now start using React JS in your code.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/hot_loading_components">Hot Loading Components</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
So this part is just freakin&#x27; awesome. With React JS and the react-hot-loader you can change the class code of your component and see the instances update live in the DOM, without losing their state! This is pretty much exactly how CSS updates behave, only that it is your components.

If you come to JavaScript from other programming languages you are familiar with types.

So the great thing about React JS is that it runs on the server too. But that does not mean you can just create any app and run it on the server. You have to make some decisions on the architecture. The reason is that even though React JS and the components run on the server, you might be having de…</p></li></ul></div><div class="nav__wrapper"><input type="checkbox" class="nav__toggle" id="nav__toggle"/><label class="nav__toggle-label" for="nav__toggle"></label><nav class="nav"><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="/">Home</a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="/blog">Read the blog</a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack">Buy the full ebook</a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href=""></a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="https://twitter.com/survivejs">@survivejs</a></div></nav></div><div class="right ribbon github-fork-ribbon-wrapper"><div class="github-fork-ribbon" style="background-color:black;"><a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues/new?title=undefined - " target="_blank">Submit feedback</a></div></div><footer><div class="footer-wrapper"><div class="footer-content-wrapper"><div class="footer-social"><h3>Social</h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/survivejs" target="_blank">@survivejs</a></li><li><a href="http://eepurl.com/bth1v5" target="_blank">Mailing List</a></li><li><a href="https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack_react" target="_blank">Gitter Chat</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/atom.xml" target="_blank">Blog RSS</a></li><li><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/OWdGIOdHm9" target="_blank">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/survivejs/ama/issues" target="_blank">Ask Me Anything</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-blog"><h3>From the Blog</h3><ul class="blog-teasers"><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/styleguidist-interview">react-styleguidist - Style guide generator for React - Interview with Artem Sapegin</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc4">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc4</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/towards-common-components">Towards a Common Component Definition</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc3">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc3</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc2">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc2</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc1">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc1</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/codemod-interview">Codemod - Refactoring Code Programmatically - Interview with Ramana Venkata</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/2015-recap">2015 Recap</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-beta2">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-beta2</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer><div><div class="gitter-open-chat-button">Need help?</div><script type="text/javascript">
