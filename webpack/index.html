Webpack (or just webpack) simplifies web development by solving a fundamental problem - the problem of bundling. It takes in various assets, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, and then transforms these assets into a format that&#x27;s easy to consume through a browser. By doing this well, it takes away …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/webpack-compared">Webpack Compared</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
You can understand better why Webpack&#x27;s approach is powerful by putting it into historical context. Back in the day, it was enough just to concatenate some scripts together. Times have changed, though, and now distributing your JavaScript code can be a complex endeavor.

This problem has escalated …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack">Developing with Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack is driven by configuration, normally named as webpack.config.js. That&#x27;s the heart of it all. The configuration defines the inputs and the outputs of your project. Most importantly, it describes the types of transformations you perform. These transformations are defined using loaders and plu…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/getting-started">Getting Started</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
If you are not one of those people who likes to skip the introductions, you might have some clue what Webpack is. In its simplicity, it is a module bundler. It takes a bunch of assets in and outputs assets you can give to your client.

This sounds simple, but in practice, it can be a complicated an…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/splitting-configuration">Splitting the Configuration</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
As the development setup has certain requirements of its own, we&#x27;ll need to split our Webpack configuration. Given Webpack configuration is just JavaScript, there are many ways to achieve this. At least the following ways are feasible:

Maintain configuration in multiple files and point Webpack to …</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/automatic-browser-refresh">Automatic Browser Refresh</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Tools, such as LiveReload or Browsersync, allow us to refresh the browser as we develop our application. They can even avoid refresh for CSS changes. It is possible to set up the latter to work with Webpack by using browser-sync-webpack-plugin. In this case I&#x27;m going to show you how to use somethin…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/developing-with-webpack/refreshing-css">Refreshing CSS</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
We can extend automatic browser refreshing to work with CSS. Webpack doesn&#x27;t even have to force a full refresh in this case.

In order to avoid some typing, we can set up a Webpack plugin known as npm-install-webpack-plugin. As we develop the project, it will detect changes made to Webpack configuration and the projects files and install the dependencies for us. It will modify package.json automatically as well.

There are times when you might want to optimize your development setup. I am going to show you one useful trick. To benefit from it, we need to make our project heavier first, though. In order to achieve this, we can install React and speed up our development build after that.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack">Building with Webpack</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
In the previous part I showed you how to set up a basic development setup with Webpack. In this part we&#x27;ll dig into build related concerns. We&#x27;ll discuss aspects like code minification, bundle splitting, and caching.
</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack/minifying-build">Minifying the Build</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
So far we haven&#x27;t given thought to our build output and no doubt it&#x27;s going to be a little chunky, especially as we included React to it. We can apply a variety of techniques to bring down the size of it. We can also leverage client level caching, load certain assets lazily. I&#x27;ll discuss the latter…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack/setting-environment-variables">Setting Environment Variables</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
React relies on process.env.NODE_ENV based optimizations. If we force it to production, React will get built in an optimized manner. This will disable some checks (e.g., property type checks). Most importantly it will give you a smaller build and improved performance.

The main advantage of splitting the application into two separate bundles is that it allows us to benefit from client level caching. We might, for instance, make most of our changes to the small app bundle. In this case, the client would have to fetch only the app bundle, assuming the vendor bundle…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack/adding-hashes-to-filenames">Adding Hashes to Filenames</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Webpack provides placeholders that can be used to access different types of hashes and entry name as we saw before. The most useful ones are:

[name] - Returns entry name.
[hash] - Returns build hash.
[chunkhash] - Returns a chunk specific hash.

Using these placeholders you could end up with filen…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack/cleaning-build">Cleaning the Build</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Our current setup doesn&#x27;t clean the build directory between builds. As this can get annoying if we change our setup, we can use a plugin to clean the directory for us.

Another valid way to resolve the issue would be to handle this outside of Webpack. You could set solve it on the system level thro…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack/separating-css">Separating CSS</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Even though we have a nice build set up now, where did all the CSS go? As per our configuration, it has been inlined to JavaScript! Even though this can be convenient during development, it doesn&#x27;t sound ideal. The current solution doesn&#x27;t allow us to cache CSS. In some cases we might suffer from a…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/building-with-webpack/analyzing-build-statistics">Analyzing Build Statistics</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Analyzing build statistics is a good step towards understanding Webpack better. We can get statistics from it easily and we can visualize them using a tool. This shows us the composition of our bundles.

In order to get suitable output we&#x27;ll need to do a couple of tweaks to our configuration:

Webpack supports a large variety of formats through loaders. In addition, it supports a couple of JavaScript module formats out of the box. Generally, the idea is always the same.

The system relies on configura…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading-assets/loading-styles">Loading Styles</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Generally loading styles follows the same idea. You set up a loader definition that matches your style files and apply the format specific loaders to it. There&#x27;s some complexity involved as you need to use multiple loaders in conjunction.

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading-assets/loading-images">Loading Images</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
The easiest way to make your application slow is to load a lot of small assets. Each request comes with an overhead after all. HTTP/2 will help in this regard and change the situation somewhat drastically. Till then we are stuck with different approaches. Webpack allows a few of these. They are par…</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/loading-assets/loading-fonts">Loading Fonts</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
Loading fonts is a surprisingly tough problem. There are typically four(!) font formats to worry about, each for certain browser. Inlining all formats at once wouldn&#x27;t be a particularly good idea. There are a couple of strategies we can consider.

Chunks are one of the most fundamental concepts of Webpack. We already touched the topic at the Splitting Bundles chapter.

Even though Webpack is useful for bundling applications, it has its uses for package authors as well. You can use it to output your bundle in the UMD format. It is a format that&#x27;s compatible with various environments (CommonJS, AMD, globals).

</p></li><li><h3 class="post-list__heading"><a class="" href="/webpack/advanced-techniques/writing-loaders">Writing Loaders</a></h3><p class="post-list__preview">
As we&#x27;ve seen so far, loaders are one of the building blocks of Webpack. If you want to load an asset, you&#x27;ll most likely need to set up a matching loader definition. Even though there are a lot of available loaders, it is possible you are missing one fitting your purposes.

There is really nothing more to it. You can now start using React JS in your code.

So this part is just freakin&#x27; awesome. With React JS and the react-hot-loader you can change the class code of your component and see the instances update live in the DOM, without losing their state! This is pretty much exactly how CSS updates behave, only that it is your components.

If you come to JavaScript from other programming languages you are familiar with types.

So the great thing about React JS is that it runs on the server too. But that does not mean you can just create any app and run it on the server. You have to make some decisions on the architecture. The reason is that even though React JS and the components run on the server, you might be having de…</p></li></ul></div><div class="nav__wrapper"><input type="checkbox" class="nav__toggle" id="nav__toggle"/><label class="nav__toggle-label" for="nav__toggle"></label><nav class="nav"><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="/">Home</a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="/blog">Read the blog</a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack">Buy the full ebook</a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href=""></a></div><div class="nav__link"><a class="" href="https://twitter.com/survivejs">@survivejs</a></div></nav></div><div class="right ribbon github-fork-ribbon-wrapper"><div class="github-fork-ribbon" style="background-color:black;"><a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues/new?title=undefined - " target="_blank">Submit feedback</a></div></div><footer><div class="footer-wrapper"><div class="footer-content-wrapper"><div class="footer-social"><h3>Social</h3><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/survivejs" target="_blank">@survivejs</a></li><li><a href="http://eepurl.com/bth1v5" target="_blank">Mailing List</a></li><li><a href="https://gitter.im/survivejs/webpack_react" target="_blank">Gitter Chat</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="/atom.xml" target="_blank">Blog RSS</a></li><li><a href="http://goo.gl/forms/OWdGIOdHm9" target="_blank">Contact</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/survivejs/ama/issues" target="_blank">Ask Me Anything</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer-blog"><h3>From the Blog</h3><ul class="blog-teasers"><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/react-rocks-interview">React.rocks - React Components and Demos - Interview with Jeff Winkler</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/reindex-interview">Reindex - Instant GraphQL Backend for Your React Apps - Interview with Ville Immonen</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs-interview">SurviveJS - Learn Webpack and React - Interview with Juho Vepsäläinen</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/styleguidist-interview">react-styleguidist - Style guide generator for React - Interview with Artem Sapegin</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc4">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc4</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/towards-common-components">Towards a Common Component Definition</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc3">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc3</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc2">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc2</a></li><li><a class="blog-teaser" href="/blog/survivejs200-rc1">SurviveJS - Webpack and React - v2.0.0-rc1</a></li></ul></div></div></div></footer><div><div class="gitter-open-chat-button">Need help?</div><script type="text/javascript">
