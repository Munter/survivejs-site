I went through &amp;quot;React and Flux&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;From Notes to Kanban&amp;quot; with my editor (thanks Jes&amp;#xFA;s!). As a result we should have something that&amp;apos;s a notch better together. I took some decompression time during this iteration and negotiated a lot towards a better future I hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In total 116 commits went to &lt;code&gt;v1.7.5&lt;/code&gt;. To make it easier to follow what happened and where, I&amp;apos;ve split up the changes below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v1.7.0...v1.7.5&quot;&gt;all changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I learned something curious about &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;an&lt;/em&gt; (no, we don&amp;apos;t have these things in Finnish). It is important to remember to take in count what the words &lt;strong&gt;sound&lt;/strong&gt; like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use nicer formatting for &lt;code&gt;npm i&lt;/code&gt; bits. Now &lt;code&gt;--&lt;/code&gt; shouldn&amp;apos;t get mangled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The introduction of the book has been expanded somewhat. There&amp;apos;s only one chance to make a first impression so might as well try to do a good one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#webpack-compared&quot; id=&quot;webpack-compared&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Webpack Compared&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#webpack-compared&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added an expanded explanation for &lt;code&gt;make&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;a href=&quot;http://jspm.io/&quot;&gt;JSPM&lt;/a&gt;. You should watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=33&amp;amp;v=iukBMY4apvI&quot;&gt;Glen Maddern&amp;apos;s&lt;/a&gt; awesome demo about it. It wouldn&amp;apos;t surprise me a lot if JSPM had a bright future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#developing-with-webpack&quot; id=&quot;developing-with-webpack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developing with Webpack&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#developing-with-webpack&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighted the importance of a proper &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;apos;ve seen some people to neglect this so I felt it&amp;apos;s good to cover. It&amp;apos;s just one of those things that saves your nerves. :)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped &lt;code&gt;colors: true&lt;/code&gt; setting from &lt;code&gt;devServer&lt;/code&gt; configuration. Reading from source I learned that &lt;code&gt;webpack-dev-server&lt;/code&gt; actually detects for terminal colors automatically. As a result this bit of configuration can be dropped.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#implementing-a-basic-note-application&quot; id=&quot;implementing-a-basic-note-application&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implementing a Basic Note Application&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#implementing-a-basic-note-application&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushed &lt;code&gt;notes&lt;/code&gt; definition outside of the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; component. This cleans up the implementation a little.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added screenshots to show what you should see after each visual step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanded the explanation of &lt;code&gt;super()&lt;/code&gt;. Remember that it refers to the method of the parent class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved the visual outlook of the add button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made sure note tasks get assigned &lt;code&gt;display: inline-block;&lt;/code&gt; to force a minimum height to them even if there&amp;apos;s no content at all. This way they can be edited even then.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#react-and-flux&quot; id=&quot;react-and-flux&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;React and Flux&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#react-and-flux&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified &lt;em&gt;Gluing It All Together&lt;/em&gt; section a lot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushed &lt;em&gt;Dispatching in Alt&lt;/em&gt; to the end. I&amp;apos;ve settled for a convention where the main content should be about getting ahead with the application whereas these sort of good to know things have been pushed to the end.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped redundant &lt;code&gt;this.notes = this.notes || [];&lt;/code&gt; check. This won&amp;apos;t be needed so it can be safely dropped. The same goes for bootstrapped data in general. It just works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified and expanded &lt;em&gt;What Are Decorators?&lt;/em&gt; and added an example showing how to implement &lt;code&gt;@log&lt;/code&gt; for logging how methods are called.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked &lt;em&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;AltContainer&lt;/code&gt; Instead of a Decorator&lt;/em&gt; for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#from-notes-to-kanban&quot; id=&quot;from-notes-to-kanban&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From Notes to Kanban&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#from-notes-to-kanban&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added screenshots to illustrate progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked &lt;em&gt;Modeling Lane&lt;/em&gt; for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked &lt;em&gt;Making Lanes Responsible of Notes&lt;/em&gt; for clarity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push &lt;code&gt;addNote&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deleteNote&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;bind&lt;/code&gt;s to &lt;code&gt;constructor&lt;/code&gt; level. Logically &lt;code&gt;Lane&lt;/code&gt; id remains the same during its lifecycle so this seemed like a safe change to make.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Highlighted important code changes using bullet points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added a section known as &lt;em&gt;On Namespacing Components&lt;/em&gt;. This is a small technique you may find handy. It allows you to model cleaner component APIs so it&amp;apos;s worth knowing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added missing &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;NoteStore&lt;/code&gt;. While at it I bummed a couple of lines of code from it. Now it&amp;apos;s as compact as it can get.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#implementing-drag-and-drop&quot; id=&quot;implementing-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Implementing Drag and Drop&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#implementing-drag-and-drop&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked introduction.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked &lt;em&gt;Preparing Notes to Be Sorted&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushed &lt;code&gt;ItemTypes&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;&amp;apos;../libs/item_types&amp;apos;&lt;/code&gt; as it&amp;apos;s not a component.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will be doing more work on this chapter to make it clearer still.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#building-kanban&quot; id=&quot;building-kanban&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Building Kanban&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#building-kanban&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added more context to the code examples to make them clearer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#authoring-libraries&quot; id=&quot;authoring-libraries&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Authoring Libraries&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#authoring-libraries&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Made sure &lt;code&gt;preversion&lt;/code&gt; hook &lt;code&gt;git commit&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;code&gt;--allow-empty&lt;/code&gt; to allow empty distribution commits to be made.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped redundant version related tip as &lt;code&gt;preversion&lt;/code&gt; hook does everything we need now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#styling-react&quot; id=&quot;styling-react&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Styling React&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#styling-react&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expanded on CSS Modules and linked to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gajus/react-css-modules&quot;&gt;gajus/react-css-modules&lt;/a&gt; as that makes it more convenient to work with them in React.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot; id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Next?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ll continue going through the content with my editor while listening to your feedback. I&amp;apos;m particularly interested in &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues/224&quot;&gt;highlighting updated lines&lt;/a&gt; as that would make it easier to follow what lines of code changed during the tutorial. I believe resolving this could help to push the book quality a notch further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the content is getting solid this means I can spend more time on producing new content. I&amp;apos;ll be focusing on typing next. Also some other plans have been put to motion but more on those later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this was yet another good step towards a quality release at Amazon. Thanks for everyone involved! You make it worthwhile. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy this release. As usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; and pull requests are welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you can support my work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react&quot;&gt;purchasing the book at Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;. Every little bit counts and allows me to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;

But what is it really about?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/bdbeb02a7fe50b769e67e0c076b33c54?size=100&quot; alt=&quot;Michel Weststrate&quot; class=&quot;author&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;100&quot;&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
I&amp;apos;m a lead developer at Mendix where I worked on both frontend and backend development. About half a year ago me and my team started working on a greenfield,  enterprise scale project where most of the complexity is on the client side. We started a small research project to find the right technology and looked into Angular, Ember and React.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;React was definitely the one that did enlighten us the most. Its mental model is really simple, it has a clearly defined scope and it is convenient to write.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-drove-you-to-develop-mobservable-why-not-to-just-stick-with-flux-&quot; id=&quot;what-drove-you-to-develop-mobservable-why-not-to-just-stick-with-flux-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What drove you to develop Mobservable? Why not to just stick with Flux?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-drove-you-to-develop-mobservable-why-not-to-just-stick-with-flux-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance and code simplicity are both very important values in our project. Performance because we have to draw hundreds of different, moving components at 50fps. Code simplicity because we have about 400 different domain concepts to cover, so all our components should be really DRY. An always-re-render-everything approach results in very simple code. But it doesn&amp;apos;t cut it in terms of performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With most Flux implementations, it really seems that to achieve performance you have to give up code simplicity. Immutable data is often presented as the way to go here. Yet it results in verbose controller (store) functions and forces you to do reference management yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With mutable data structures, it is trivial to guarantee that there is only one version of a certain domain object in memory. So you never have to worry whether you leaked an old reference. With immutable data, pointer equality guarantees structural equality. Which is nice in terms of optimizations and history. Yet with mutable data, pointer equality means that you are looking at conceptually the same (and latest) thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So our goal for Mobservable is: Be able to write components that look like they are always fully rendered. Without needing nifty things like cursors or store subscriptions. To achieve DRY: the render function is the dependency tree, and nothing else. For our model and controller code we wanted to be able to write vanilla JS code as much as possible. Be able to use the mutable arrays and objects, cyclic data-structures and classes. I think Mobservable achieves these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#mobservable-can-work-with-flux&quot; id=&quot;mobservable-can-work-with-flux&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Mobservable can work &lt;strong&gt;with&lt;/strong&gt; Flux&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#mobservable-can-work-with-flux&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is actually funny that you present Mobservable as an alternative to Flux. Mobservable can be combined with most Flux implementations. But I heard indeed from several people that they dropped Flux after starting to use Mobservable in their project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the issue with Flux is that it is very obtrusive to your code base. If you use React and Flux together, it impacts your whole codebase. While just React nicely separates the concerns of view and &amp;apos;the rest&amp;apos;. With Flux frameworks you go all-in. That introduces new problems like: &amp;apos;how do I do async actions&amp;apos; and &amp;apos;my actions need to go through the stores in a certain order&amp;apos;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That makes me wonder: Did you have these questions when building vanilla JavaScript applications? What do you get in return from Flux? I think most things offered by Flux can also be achieved by disciplined programming. Stuff like uni-directional flow and making it clear where your state lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#on-frameworks-vs-libraries&quot; id=&quot;on-frameworks-vs-libraries&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;On frameworks vs. libraries&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#on-frameworks-vs-libraries&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Mendix we are pretty reluctant to use all-in frameworks. The first two years they serve you really well. But the third year they cannot longer keep up the pace with new technologies. The fourth year you spent refactoring just be able to adopt new technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have learned from that, so Mobservable tries to be as unobtrusive as possible. Less obtrusive than frameworks that use immutables, cursors or reactive streams. So that you have a great deal of flexibility in how you structure your controller, view and model code (or actions and stores).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-your-next-steps-how-do-you-plan-to-develop-mobservable-further-&quot; id=&quot;what-are-your-next-steps-how-do-you-plan-to-develop-mobservable-further-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What are your next steps? How do you plan to develop Mobservable further?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-are-your-next-steps-how-do-you-plan-to-develop-mobservable-further-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mobservable is all about updating views on your data automatically. People often interpret views as &amp;apos;user interface&amp;apos; and this plays a central role indeed in the React integration. But reactive data is really convenient for backend integration as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our project we do not only use Mobservable to update the user interface, but also to create a changelog that is sent to the backend server. Both are just views on the same data. I hope to get this idea more clear and to find some nice convenience methods that hints users in this direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, Mobservable will include a way to visualize all the relations between state and views. This will provide great insight in the actual flow of state through your application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And maybe I should write some Flux thingy around Mobservable and React. Because either people seem to think you need to Flux in order to properly React. Or they just love to be guided in how to setup each part of their application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-&quot; id=&quot;what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What does the future look like for React? Can you see any particular trends?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-does-the-future-look-like-for-react-can-you-see-any-particular-trends-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think React has a brighter future than Angular. Simply because you aren&amp;apos;t stuck with a full fledged framework that you have to obey, or it will work against you. But React has to keep an ecosystem that prefers composition of micro libraries over all-in-one solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is also the reason that small editors like Sublime and Atom in combination with standalone build tools like Grunt and Gulp are now more popular than feature creeped IDEs (I think, I don&amp;apos;t have any numbers on that).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No framework lives forever. So if you want to make sure your software outlives your frameworks, you have to be able to replace your libraries one by one. One day you will wake up to discover that browsers are fast enough to re-calculate your whole application on each state change. Then you just remove Mobservable and everything will work just the same as the day before without a major refactoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;m very interested to see what Relay will do in this regard. Because from a bird&amp;apos;s eye view it seems to increase the coupling between view, controller and backend. Making it much harder to replace any of these parts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dan Abramov, his &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/gaearon/redux&quot;&gt;redux&lt;/a&gt; is the only &amp;apos;Flux implementation&amp;apos; I could see myself using. It is not unobtrusive if you are coming from the mutable world, but the mental model of redux is beautiful and the dev tools are fun. I can imagine it works really well in (at least) medium sized applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the interview Michel! It was certainly enlightening. We ported the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/mobservable-demo&quot;&gt;Notes and Kanban examples to Mobservable&lt;/a&gt;. Check out the source to see how this worked out. Compared to the original I was definitely positively surprised. Mobservable seems like a good fit for these problems. You can play around with Mobservable online by taking the &lt;a href=&quot;https://mweststrate.github.io/mobservable/getting-started.html&quot;&gt;five minute, interactive introduction to Mobservable + React&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Michel goes into more detail at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mendix.com/tech-blog/making-react-reactive-pursuit-high-performing-easily-maintainable-react-apps/&quot;&gt;his post about making React reactive&lt;/a&gt;. So if this article piqued your interest that might be a worthwhile read. Of course you can just hop into the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mweststrate/react-mobservable-boilerplate&quot;&gt;mobservable boilerplate&lt;/a&gt; and proceed from there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#development-model-changes&quot; id=&quot;development-model-changes&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Development Model Changes&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#development-model-changes&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;apos;ve moved to a staged development model. Now I maintain &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt; branches. &lt;code&gt;master&lt;/code&gt; contains the current stable release. All development happens at &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt;. This way the code examples stay in sync with the book and the site. Less frustration and a better book for everyone. If you have PRs in mind, please make them against &lt;code&gt;dev&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#book-improvements-v1-6-&quot; id=&quot;book-improvements-v1-6-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Book Improvements - &lt;code&gt;v1.6&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#book-improvements-v1-6-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In total 63 commits went to &lt;code&gt;v1.6&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some typo fixes were made. A lot more follow in &lt;code&gt;v1.7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;webpack-dev-server&lt;/code&gt; configuration was pushed to &lt;code&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noted that &lt;code&gt;webpack.config.babel.js&lt;/code&gt; works. I&amp;apos;ve expanded on this at &lt;code&gt;v1.7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lot of effort went into making &lt;em&gt;Implementing a Basic Note Application&lt;/em&gt; easier to approach&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped custom &lt;code&gt;findIndex&lt;/code&gt;. In &lt;code&gt;v1.7&lt;/code&gt; I went further and now it uses &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.npmjs.com/package/array.prototype.findindex&quot;&gt;array.prototype.findindex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added imagery to &lt;em&gt;React and Flux&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mentioned that &lt;code&gt;-S&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;-D&lt;/code&gt; map to &lt;code&gt;npm i --save&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;npm i --save-dev&lt;/code&gt;. This is just for you keyboard jockeys out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added the book subtitle to the cover. It looked strange without.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Formatted all &lt;code&gt;npm i&lt;/code&gt; parts so that they stand out better. The web version uses special formatting reminiscent of a real terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v1.5.0...v1.6.0&quot;&gt;all changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#book-improvements-v1-7-&quot; id=&quot;book-improvements-v1-7-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Book Improvements - &lt;code&gt;v1.7&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#book-improvements-v1-7-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;108 commits went to &lt;code&gt;v1.7&lt;/code&gt;. So based on numbers it was busier. Especially the early part of the week was good. After that it was all berries and mushrooms for me. It&amp;apos;s the season after all and Winter is coming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A massive amount of typo and grammar fixes were made in this iteration. I tried my luck with Fiverr and it paid off seriously. Thank you Ava and Nancy! There might be some left still but we squashed quite a few. I also ran the content through &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hemingwayapp.com/&quot;&gt;Hemingway&lt;/a&gt; to simplify sentence structures where needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I managed to make &lt;em&gt;webpack.config.js&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;TARGET&lt;/code&gt; selection cross-platform. Now the configuration relies on &lt;code&gt;process.env.npm_lifecycle_event&lt;/code&gt;. npm sets that during execution and we can rely on that. Thanks Hector for pointing me to the right direction!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clarified point about &lt;code&gt;eval&lt;/code&gt;. As it happens Webpack provides multiple &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html#devtool&quot;&gt;devtool&lt;/a&gt; options. I suggest &lt;code&gt;eval-source-map&lt;/code&gt; for development in small projects. You can try faster, lower quality options with bigger projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Noted that it&amp;apos;s possible to exit Node.js repl using &lt;code&gt;CTRL-D&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;CTRL-C&lt;/code&gt;. Thanks to Ahmed for pointing this out!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved Kanban project naming (consistent with CRUD) overall. Now it should read a little better. I also pushed reference related logic to a store method. It&amp;apos;s nicer but still a lot of code considering what it actually does. As long as we operate through indices like this, there&amp;apos;s no neat way around it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Showed how to set up isomorphic rendering for the Kanban application. It&amp;apos;s not that useful in this case. I do hope you get the idea as it&amp;apos;s powerful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dropped deployment chapter. As I managed to explain isomorphic rendering earlier in the previous point, the deployment chapter became redundant. Good riddance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added JSX suffixes to imports. As the project gets run through Node.js context when rendering in an isomorphic way, I had to add JSX suffixes. Perhaps someone knows a better solution but this made sense at the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pushed id creation inside stores. The reasoning for this is that if you are dealing with a real back-end, that&amp;apos;s the way it goes. You should &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have to think about ids at view level so it&amp;apos;s better to do it right. Besides now gluing a real back-end with the project is a notch easier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reworked the early part of the Flux chapter with my editor (thanks Jes&amp;#xFA;s!). The chapter can likely still be improved but it&amp;apos;s better now. It&amp;apos;s a little long to my tastes but on the other hand it covers a lot of ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ended up using term &lt;em&gt;Webpack&lt;/em&gt; everywhere. I know &lt;em&gt;webpack&lt;/em&gt; is the correct name but I went for consistency here. So consider that &amp;quot;Webpack&amp;quot; == &amp;quot;webpack&amp;quot;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to get some screenshots done for this iteration too and work on a Leanpub exclusive chapter. This work will go to the next iteration. The good news are that now there&amp;apos;s far less to worry about so I&amp;apos;m more likely to get these tasks done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v1.6.0...v1.7.0&quot;&gt;all changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot; id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Next?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fail to plan, plan to fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to me the book is on a good track and we&amp;apos;re making steady progress. New people are finding the book and even buying it. And the feedback has been good. I know the book isn&amp;apos;t everyone&amp;apos;s piece of cake. But I&amp;apos;m okay with that. By trying to please everyone you please none.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#going-amazon&quot; id=&quot;going-amazon&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Going Amazon&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#going-amazon&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next major goal for me is to get the book to Amazon, iBooks and such through &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lulu.com/&quot;&gt;Lulu&lt;/a&gt;. This might also provide us a paper version if there&amp;apos;s demand. Enhanced distribution could go a long way in improving sales. After all I&amp;apos;ll need to make this work financially in order to be able to write more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this to happen we&amp;apos;ll need to lock the scope of the book. This is due to ISBN requirements. You can make small changes to a published book but nowhere on the level what we&amp;apos;re doing right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#but-there-s-more-technology-to-cover&quot; id=&quot;but-there-s-more-technology-to-cover&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;But There&amp;apos;s More Technology to Cover&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#but-there-s-more-technology-to-cover&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know interesting new technology, such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rackt/redux&quot;&gt;redux&lt;/a&gt;, keeps on coming out all the time. The problem is that if I keep on changing the newest cool thing I will never get a stable version out. It is far better idea to lock the scope and cover the interesting things through the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gives me a more flexible way to try out various ideas before committing them to a book. It also helps to give the current work some visibility it sorely needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#the-current-plan&quot; id=&quot;the-current-plan&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The Current Plan&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#the-current-plan&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a result the current plan is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue iterating on the current content based on feedback. No major changes to the chapter structure anymore, just minor tweaks to make the book more approachable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write chapters that are unique for the commercial edition. This improves the value proposition and actually might encourage more people to buy the book. After all, that enables more content! I expect at least three chapters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand this blog with supporting topics. I have a nice series of posts planned up and I welcome ideas. I want more people to discover the book and this could go a long way towards that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Figure out how Hacker News works. I did try &lt;em&gt;Show HN&lt;/em&gt; but received zero response. Perhaps I&amp;apos;ll have better luck next time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So towards the Amazon release I go. It might be interesting to try running some sort of campaign to eventually open the unique content. For now I will need to let the commercial version to have some leverage over the community edition. Perhaps there&amp;apos;s a way to align these two goals (community content, making a living) but as for now this might be the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be able to tell a lot more after a wider scale release. Given I&amp;apos;m a first time author I&amp;apos;m still learning the ropes here and no doubt making a lot of mistakes in the process. I have other book ideas but I&amp;apos;ll have to get this first one out before I can even think about those. Perhaps within a year or so I can do an expanded second edition. Any sooner and I&amp;apos;m pissing off my first edition readers. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy this release. As usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; and pull requests are welcome. It&amp;apos;s interesting to write a book this way. That&amp;apos;s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you can support my work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react&quot;&gt;purchasing the book at Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;. Every little bit counts and allows me to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;

You have to know who you are against after all! It&amp;apos;s not an understatement to say could that it&amp;apos;s about to get swarmed with books. In this post I&amp;apos;ll go through the ones I could find and provide you some intel on them. Perhaps you would like to get a couple of books to your collection!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#free-books&quot; id=&quot;free-books&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Free Books&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#free-books&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/enaqx/awesome-react&quot;&gt;a lot of freely available React resources&lt;/a&gt; there aren&amp;apos;t too many free books yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#survivejs-webpack-and-react&quot; id=&quot;survivejs-webpack-and-react&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;SurviveJS - Webpack and React&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#survivejs-webpack-and-react&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://survivejs.com/&quot;&gt;SurviveJS - Webpack and React&lt;/a&gt; is the most comprehensive freely available book I&amp;apos;m aware of. It will show you how to set up a &lt;a href=&quot;https://webpack.github.io/&quot;&gt;webpack&lt;/a&gt; based development environment and then develop a simple &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban&quot;&gt;Kanban&lt;/a&gt; based on it. More theoretical topics, such as linting, styling and library authoring are discussed as well. At the time of writing it has 150 pages and more content is planned based on demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is open to external contributions and in fact a lot of people have contributed feedback and fixes. From author&amp;apos;s point of view this has been just awesome!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you like the book and want to support the effort, &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react&quot;&gt;buying a copy&lt;/a&gt; would most likely make the author&amp;apos;s day. Suggested price without VAT is $20 though minimum of $15 is possible. Pay based on value you perceive as Leanpub books allow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/&quot;&gt;React Webpack Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; is a little guide I developed with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.christianalfoni.com/&quot;&gt;Christian Alfoni&lt;/a&gt;. The eventual plan is to polish the content and host the improved version here with a similar support model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#commercial-books&quot; id=&quot;commercial-books&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Commercial Books&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#commercial-books&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The commercial side of React books is about to go wild. &lt;strong&gt;Developing a React Edge&lt;/strong&gt; was likely the first book on the market. Since then a few others have followed. The challenge for authors is that as React moves forward quite fast. Books will require constant maintenance effort to stay up to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#developing-a-react-edge-the-javascript-library-for-user-interfaces&quot; id=&quot;developing-a-react-edge-the-javascript-library-for-user-interfaces&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Developing a React Edge: The JavaScript Library for User Interfaces&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#developing-a-react-edge-the-javascript-library-for-user-interfaces&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781939902122.do&quot;&gt;Developing a React Edge&lt;/a&gt; by Frankie Bagnardi, Jonathan Beebe, Richard Feldman, Tom Hallett, Simon H&amp;#xF8;jberg and Karl Mikkelsen was published by Bleeding Edge Press at November 2014. At 234 pages it covers a wide range of React related issues starting from the very basics and including aspects such performance tuning, server side rendering and testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I haven&amp;apos;t bought the book it is hard for me to evaluate how up to date it is. The book has both digital and paperback versions available. At Amazon the price is around $30 for both VAT included. At O&amp;apos;Reilly digital edition costs $22.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#react-d3-js&quot; id=&quot;react-d3-js&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;React+d3.js&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#react-d3-js&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://swizec.com/reactd3js/&quot;&gt;React+d3.js&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://swizec.com/&quot;&gt;Swizec Teller&lt;/a&gt; is a focused book at 63 pages. At &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/reactd3js&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt; it&amp;apos;s minimum price is $9 while suggested on is at $19 VAT excluded. There are expanded packages available that provide more material such as screencast and example code. In the book you will build a small data visualization project based on the technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a quick read that&amp;apos;s straight to the point, this could be it. It&amp;apos;s nowhere broad as &lt;strong&gt;Developing a React Edge&lt;/strong&gt; for instance but if you just want to visualize data, this might work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/descubre-react&quot;&gt;Descubre React&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://soyjavi.com/&quot;&gt;Javi Jim&amp;#xE9;nez&lt;/a&gt; is a Spanish introduction to React. It has 83 pages and its minimum price is $12.49 VAT excluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a Spanish introduction to React, here&amp;apos;s your only option at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.arkency.com/rails-react/&quot;&gt;Rails Meets React.js&lt;/a&gt; by Marcin Grzywaczewski and &lt;a href=&quot;http://robert.pankowecki.pl/&quot;&gt;Robert Pankowecki&lt;/a&gt; explains how to get started with React in Ruby on Rails environment. The book is available through Arkency for $49 and has over 150 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on table of contents the book shows you how to get started from scratch, how to set up an effective asset pipeline and of course how to integrate with Rails. The book covers also concepts such as testing, forms and i18n. Note that React portions have been written in CoffeeScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#react-by-example&quot; id=&quot;react-by-example&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;React by Example&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#react-by-example&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://reactkungfu.com/react-by-example/&quot;&gt;React by Example&lt;/a&gt; by Arkency explains React through numerous examples. The book shows how to build a password strength meter, credit card input and Twitter posting box for instance. The book is available for $49 and has over 130 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to learn React through a series of specific examples this might be the way to go. Even though the book is in early access it has sold already over 200 copies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#easy-react&quot; id=&quot;easy-react&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Easy React&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#easy-react&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://easyreactbook.com/&quot;&gt;Easy React&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wjgilmore.com/&quot;&gt;W. Jason Gilmore&lt;/a&gt; is available through &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/easyreact&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;. The book is currently in beta and the price starts from $14.99 without VAT. At the time of writing it has 83 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy React&lt;/strong&gt; is a project based book and focuses on an application known as &lt;em&gt;VocabGiant&lt;/em&gt;, a language learning tool. The book discusses a wide range of topics ranging from setting up a development environment, developing the app (Flux included), developing a backend (REST + Express + MongoDB) and React Native. So by the looks of it this should be a great book for a full stack developer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#reactjs-cookbook&quot; id=&quot;reactjs-cookbook&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;ReactJS Cookbook&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#reactjs-cookbook&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/reactjs-cookbook&quot;&gt;ReactJS Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by Johannes Stein is available through Packt exclusively at the moment. It is on preorder for $39.68 and is due November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As many books discussed by now, &lt;strong&gt;ReactJS Cookbook&lt;/strong&gt; shows you how React components work and goes into topics such as animation, isomorphism, ES6 and testing. It is expected to have 301 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#react-js-essentials&quot; id=&quot;react-js-essentials&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;React.js Essentials&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#react-js-essentials&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/reactjs-essentials&quot;&gt;React.js Essentials&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://artemij.com/&quot;&gt;Artemij Fedosejev&lt;/a&gt; is available through Packt and Amazon. At Packt preorder price of the digital version is $23.80 while at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/React-js-Essentials-Artemij-Fedosejev-ebook/dp/B00YSILZRW&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; Kindle version is available for $29.75. According to Packt site the book should been available in July but Amazon has expected date at January 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is expected to have 194 pages. It covers basics of React and goes into architecture (Flux). There is also information about testing (Jest). No official table of contents is available as of yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.apress.com/9781484212462&quot;&gt;Introduction to React&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://cgack.blogspot.com&quot;&gt;Cory Gackenheimer&lt;/a&gt; is available through Apress and Amazon. At Apress digital edition is available for $17.99 while print costs $24.99. At Amazon paperback costs $19.68. The book is expected to be available at September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The planned length of the book is 170 pages and it will cover basics of React, Flux architecture and testing at least. There is also specific discussion about JSX.&lt;/p&gt;

At O&amp;apos;Reilly digital early access version costs $33.99 while print goes for $39.99. At Amazon print is slightly cheaper at $37.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early chapters of the book are already available and according to Amazon the full book should be completed by December. The book will have around 250 pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I probably don&amp;apos;t need to repeat myself here. Expect to learn basics of React and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://ludovf.net/reactbook/&quot;&gt;Master React&lt;/a&gt; by Ludovico Fischer doesn&amp;apos;t have a lot of information available yet. Digital version of the book is due Autumn and there is some early content at the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By the looks of the book will go through a wide range of React related concepts. These include development tools, third party libraries, JSX and server-side React as with so many other books.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;apos;s also an emerging category of React Native books and the first book has already been released and more are on their way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native&quot; id=&quot;beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Beginning Mobile App Development with React Native&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native.com/&quot;&gt;Beginning Mobile App Development with React Native&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://manuel.kiessling.net/&quot;&gt;Manuel Kiessling&lt;/a&gt; is likely the first book on the market. It is available through &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/beginning-mobile-app-development-with-react-native&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt; for $29.99 (no VAT) and has 82 pages guiding you into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041511.do&quot;&gt;Learning React Native&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.bonnieeisenman.com/&quot;&gt;Bonnie Eisenman&lt;/a&gt; is available through O&amp;apos;Reilly and Amazon. At O&amp;apos;Reilly digital early access version costs $33.99 while print goes for $39.99. At Amazon print is available for $32.59 and is expected to deliver at December. The book will be around 200 pages long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of the React books have significant overlap. Their length ranges from very short (63 pages) up to quite long (301 pages). There&amp;apos;s also wide variance in pricing as a result. The cheapest goes for $9 while the most expensive costs $49. There are both self-published options and books backed by a publisher. It is hard to comment on the quality of the books as I haven&amp;apos;t read these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The situation is very interesting. It&amp;apos;s going to be difficult for a book to stand out content-wise. The biggest differentiating factor I can see is actually openness of the book. My book is a notable exception to the rule. It&amp;apos;s going to be interesting to see if it makes any difference compared to the competition and publisher backed options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if I missed some awesome book at the comments and I&amp;apos;ll add it to the listing.&lt;/p&gt;

Of course it was up to me to do most of the work. That said it is always amazing to get external contributions. It always makes my day when I get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to give my biggest thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Foxandxss&quot;&gt;Jes&amp;#xFA;s Rodr&amp;#xED;guez Rodr&amp;#xED;guez&lt;/a&gt;, my new official editor! It&amp;apos;s not understatement to say that he motivated most of the changes you see in the current revision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#book-improvements&quot; id=&quot;book-improvements&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Book Improvements&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#book-improvements&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book has been improved in various important ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The early part of the book gets faster to the interesting parts (i.e. React). I removed some of the fluff (Flow, redundant &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; etc.) and eliminated the old &lt;code&gt;Getting Started&lt;/code&gt; chapter. Now you jump straight to &lt;a href=&quot;/webpack_react/developing_with_webpack&quot;&gt;developing with webpack&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There&amp;apos;s a new chapter about &lt;a href=&quot;/webpack_react/building_kanban&quot;&gt;building the Kanban project&lt;/a&gt;. I focus on production related concerns there solely and discuss various related techniques. I believe some of those might be useful even if you don&amp;apos;t care about the project itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The architecture of the Kanban application has been revamped to be singleton based. This is more faithful to the way &lt;a href=&quot;https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html&quot;&gt;Flux architecture&lt;/a&gt; has been designed to use. There are some parts of code that aren&amp;apos;t particularly beautiful and there&amp;apos;s likely some room for improvement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More insightful explanations. Instead of dropping some code and waiting you to decipher it I&amp;apos;ve moved to &lt;strong&gt;explain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;show code&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;what happened&lt;/strong&gt; kind of model that should be hopefully easier to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition there are hundreds of other fixes. But you know me, I don&amp;apos;t like to ramble too much. You can see GitHub for &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/compare/v1.1.0...v1.5.0&quot;&gt;all changes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#known-issues&quot; id=&quot;known-issues&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Known Issues&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#known-issues&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The portions dealing with Alt don&amp;apos;t support hot loading yet. I will have to craft a pull request to fix &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/goatslacker/alt/issues/408&quot;&gt;a hot loading issue&lt;/a&gt;. Doing that should improve your experience a bit. So be prepared to refresh the old fashioned way for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot; id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Next?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will prioritize my work depending on the feedback this release receives. I know some of the current content can be pushed further. For instance &lt;a href=&quot;/webpack_react/deploying_applications&quot;&gt;deployment chapter&lt;/a&gt; could use some TLC. On the other hand it would be a good idea to start serving my paying clients (i.e. Leanpub readers) better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given I want to provide the guys that support me a little extra something I&amp;apos;ve thought of making &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22bonus+chapter%22&quot;&gt;bonus chapters&lt;/a&gt; available on early access through Leanpub. The chapters would become available to public as certain conditions are met.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to encourage you to encourage me I could tie it to amount of readers. There are two hundred readers right now. I could release a new chapter as another two hundred are gained for instance until I run out of chapters to write. I believe this would be a fair way to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope you enjoy this release. There&amp;apos;s a lot of content to go through. As usual &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react/issues&quot;&gt;feedback&lt;/a&gt; and pull requests are welcome. I hope you enjoy the improved version of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember that you can support my work by &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/survivejs_webpack_react&quot;&gt;purchasing the book at Leanpub&lt;/a&gt;. Every little bit counts and allows me to keep it up.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry ><title >Web Design is Scrappy</title><id >awebdesignisscrappy2015-07-17t00:00:00+03:00</id><link href="http://survivejs.com/blog/web-design-is-scrappy"></link><updated >2015-07-17T00:00:00+03:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you had to describe my approach to web design in one word the word would be scrappy. I rather get something to work fast than agonize on details. It is going to take a fair amount of iteration no matter what. This site is a good example of scrappy design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#getting-scrappy&quot; id=&quot;getting-scrappy&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Getting Scrappy&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#getting-scrappy&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started from a base design created by &lt;a href=&quot;http://eldh.co/&quot;&gt;Andreas Eldh&lt;/a&gt;. We have developed a static site generator known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://antwarjs.github.io/&quot;&gt;Antwar&lt;/a&gt; together. Incidentally it is based upon webpack and React. And Antwar itself is based on an &lt;a href=&quot;http://braddenver.com/blog/2015/react-static-site.html&quot;&gt;experiment by Brad Denver&lt;/a&gt;. Feeling scrappy yet?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As nothing is harder than evaluating your own work I looked actively for feedback during the development process. I had to &lt;a href=&quot;https://antwarjs.github.io/blog/antwar-050/&quot;&gt;develop Antwar further&lt;/a&gt; in order to reach my goals. Besides the technical part I also had to make sure the content is accessible and that there&amp;apos;s marketing copy in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The design is scrappy in sense that I integrated ideas from various sources. Sometimes I might realize something randomly and will just add it there. A good example is the recent addition of commenting per chapter. I understood it might be a nice way to get some extra feedback on content and help me to see potential problems clearer. And given it was fast to add, it made perfect sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#services-to-support-scrappy-design&quot; id=&quot;services-to-support-scrappy-design&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Services to Support Scrappy Design&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#services-to-support-scrappy-design&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides asking for feedback from friends and sometimes total strangers I used a couple of services with varying results. Out of the services &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.criticue.com/&quot;&gt;criticue&lt;/a&gt; worked the best for me. Often it&amp;apos;s the negative feedback that helps you the most. Criticue helped me to prune out the worst mishaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I had good experiences of &lt;a href=&quot;http://feedbackroulette.com/&quot;&gt;Feedback roulette&lt;/a&gt; in the past I set it up too. Unfortunately I have yet to receive single useful round of feedback even though I have a single credit for testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://fivesecondtest.com/&quot;&gt;Five Second Test&lt;/a&gt; was useful for getting answers to specific design issues. I didn&amp;apos;t use it a lot, though, but I can see its value. The response times were adequate as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these services allow you to earn credits by providing feedback yourself. Even though this takes time it can be enlightening to see designs of other people and help them to improve. Perhaps over longer term you might develop a stronger intuition for design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot; id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Next?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the current design of the site is quite passable. It doesn&amp;apos;t remind me of the 90s too much at least. I&amp;apos;m sure it could be better in some ways but as they say you are blind to your own work. I have outlined some issues I&amp;apos;m aware of at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/site/issues&quot;&gt;site issue tracker&lt;/a&gt;. If you have any ideas, please set up issues there for me to study or comment on this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would love to have more functionality on the site. Even though Disqus comments work I believe Medium style commenting system would work better for books. Unfortunately I haven&amp;apos;t been able to find a suitable 3rd party service for this purpose yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice to have more interactivity. Web as a platform would allow that but of course it&amp;apos;s going to require a lot of work to pull off. That said if you are aiming for the maximum amount of awesomeness, go interactive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-could-have-been-done-differently-&quot; id=&quot;what-could-have-been-done-differently-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Could Have Been Done Differently?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-could-have-been-done-differently-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would have probably saved a great deal of time by going with some established solution such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com/&quot;&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt; supports Jekyll particularly well and I have even written a &lt;a href=&quot;http://yeswejekyll.com/&quot;&gt;scrappy guide for it&lt;/a&gt; so I know the topic. I&amp;apos;m also aware of the limitations of Jekyll. Developing Antwar gave me a good excuse to learn more about the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whole site design could have been bought from elsewhere. Same goes for marketing copy, photography and such. In fact this given me a good excuse to work on these skills. That said it may be a good idea to use professional services in the future. After all they have spent years honing their skills and will be able to get better results faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope this brief post gave you some idea of why the site is the way it is. If you like the design or just want to study how it has been made, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/site&quot;&gt;site repository&lt;/a&gt;. The source itself might be a little scrappy in parts but that&amp;apos;s to be expected. It&amp;apos;s a scrappy design after all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I suppose the nicest thing about working on a webpack and React stack is that it gives me a nice amount of flexibility. I can build layouts using React and author using Markdown. That&amp;apos;s the best out of both worlds. Antwar is still missing some of the functionality you might expect (pagination, tagging etc.) but it keeps on growing as I use it. No need to aim for perfection the first time around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel web design is scrappy by definition. It is hard to get everything right the first time around. It is a good idea to leave room for creativity and experimentation. I suppose taken further you would start running tests on your site and looking at the numbers. So far my approach has been guided by intuition and might not be the best when compared to data based approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
</content></entry><entry ><title >Reaching Towards the Next Level</title><id >areachingtowardsthenextlevel2015-07-15t00:00:00+03:00</id><link href="http://survivejs.com/blog/reaching-towards-the-next-level"></link><updated >2015-07-15T00:00:00+03:00</updated><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href=&quot;../balance&quot;&gt;my previous post&lt;/a&gt; I discussed some of the difficulties of related to technical publishing. I also presented a possible solution, a mixed model that might make open publishing more feasible. The idea is that starting closed and asking for money beforehand you reward early adopters while decreasing the risk of the author. As the content gets opened eventually others can benefit from it. I know this goes against the common wisdoms of book publishing but it&amp;apos;s a model I would like to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has become apparent to me that if I put my weight behind it, I could grow this into a business that&amp;apos;s able to support me and perhaps a few others should I get so lucky. Even though Finland has its issues it isn&amp;apos;t a bad place to start a company. In fact there&amp;apos;s support for starting businesses that can help to cover starting costs up to 18 months. It will be enough to get past the beginning stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-would-a-viable-business-look-like-&quot; id=&quot;what-would-a-viable-business-look-like-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Would a Viable Business Look Like?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-would-a-viable-business-look-like-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to get by I would have to make around $1500 per month after taxes. That&amp;apos;s $50 per day. In terms of book sales that would mean five sales per day assuming a book costs $20 (half goes to side costs). It doesn&amp;apos;t sound so hard when put this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately book sales aren&amp;apos;t the only towards a sustainable business. More specialized products can be built on top of the freely available content. In addition I&amp;apos;m open to consulting. In the end it comes down to finding the ways in which I can be most useful and provide most value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#it-s-about-helping-other-developers&quot; id=&quot;it-s-about-helping-other-developers&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;It&amp;apos;s About Helping Other Developers&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#it-s-about-helping-other-developers&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a developer myself I have known my share of pain. SurviveJS is about that. I want you to avoid some of that pain. If I can make someone&amp;apos;s life a little easier through SurviveJS I have done my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides helping developers I would love to be able to help smoothen the way for other technical authors. Getting started is tough and anything you can do to make it less so is welcome. Leanpub helps in its own way but it isn&amp;apos;t nearly enough. There are just so many things to worry about. And should you fail at some critical aspect, you end up with a dud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#next-steps&quot; id=&quot;next-steps&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Next Steps&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#next-steps&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My next major goal is to resolve the biggest remaining issues related to the book and get a release out on 31st. After that I&amp;apos;ll expand distribution to see if that makes any difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a couple of older books in backburner waiting to be edited. One of them is &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/&quot;&gt;Webpack and React Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;. It deserves a refresh and an editing pass. As the content is already freely available that won&amp;apos;t change. Ebook will cost, though, and will hopefully provide some financial relief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another, older effort known as &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/js_tricks_and_tips&quot;&gt;JavaScript Tips and Tricks&lt;/a&gt;, will require a bigger refresh. It&amp;apos;s actually the original &amp;quot;SurviveJS&amp;quot; and the reason why I ended up with the name. The idea of this book is to go through a variety of JavaScript techniques to give you deeper insight to the language. It won&amp;apos;t be a long book. It&amp;apos;s more of a &amp;quot;oh, I can do that?&amp;quot; type of an affair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over shorter term I want to establish little streams like these. After all every dollar counts at this point. The sooner I can reach my viability goal, the better. Over longer term I would love to grow the brand to help other technical authors. But before I can do that I need to help myself and figure out these things. Fortunately I won&amp;apos;t have to do that alone as community support has shown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Becoming incorporated is both an exciting and a scary step. So far community response has been great so why not to push it and see if this can be turned into a real business? The numbers look realistic to me. In the worst case it won&amp;apos;t work out and I end up with a ton of references to use at a job interview. In the best case I&amp;apos;ll have a little business that will allow me to produce even more content and most importantly keep on helping.&lt;/p&gt;

The question is how to achieve that most effectively. In my &lt;a href=&quot;../the-story-so-far&quot;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; I discussed how I have fared with my first effort so far. The results have been mixed. Community response has been amazing in many ways but that hasn&amp;apos;t translated to amazing sales. That said I&amp;apos;m grateful to all that have contributed. In the end sales enable further efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was likely naive in thinking that having the content freely available while offering a way to purchase a digital copy would work by default. The greatest benefit of this approach has been possible extra visibility (easy to link) and the amount of external contributions. I believe this has improved the quality of the book further than I could have ever achieved alone. Next time around I might have a group of people that are interested in pushing the content straight from the start!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an author you have a couple of options. You can try to pitch your idea to an established publisher. They would take care of the logistics, provide editing and help with the marketing and sales efforts. In return they would take a significant chunk of the profit. Normally you can expect a royalty between 15 and 50 percent per sale depending on the publisher. If you are a tough negotiator you can receive an advance. That will help to fund authoring and will be deduced from potential profits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another option is to self-publish. You will take care of the bits a traditional publisher would. In return you receive a larger chunk of the profit but on the downside you have more work ahead of you. Especially as a first time author this will include some additional risk as you have to learn these things. If you don&amp;apos;t have a pre-existing audience you will have to earn it. More established authors have an advantage here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#self-publishing-approaches&quot; id=&quot;self-publishing-approaches&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Self-publishing Approaches&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#self-publishing-approaches&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you choose self-publishing you have some additional alternatives. You can do it the old fashioned way. First you find the potential reader somehow, demonstrate the value and close the sale. This isn&amp;apos;t the only way, though. Making the content freely available makes the sales effort voluntary. You can gain value, consider it zero and move along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can also try to compromise between these ends. Having some of the content available may encourage the potential reader to purchase the rest. You can also refine the content into different formats (audio/video) and aim to produce most of the income through that. A book can give you certain amount of prestige and lead to consulting opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest benefit of having the content freely available is that it becomes easy to share it. It won&amp;apos;t feel like selling. You can gently point towards your content without feeling too bad. Your readers can contribute directly without having to go through an errata process. Business-wise the problem is that you are relying on generosity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want something equivalent to an advance, there are a couple of alternatives. Platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.indiegogo.com/&quot;&gt;Indiegogo&lt;/a&gt; have become popular. Essentially they provide one way to receive pre-sales and validate the concept. Platforms such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.patreon.com/&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; allow you to receive donations that can contribute towards your efforts. Feasibility of these depends upon your legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To measure potential interest before moving on with your idea you can set up a light landing page. There are services such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.launchrock.com/&quot;&gt;Launchrock&lt;/a&gt; that will allow you to set up one easily. You can start gathering emails of the interested readers and begin to build your audience. I went the hard way and build a site of my own but that doesn&amp;apos;t mean you have to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#an-alternative-self-publishing-approach&quot; id=&quot;an-alternative-self-publishing-approach&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;An Alternative Self-publishing Approach&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#an-alternative-self-publishing-approach&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given it is not possible for me to leverage donations or crowdfunding without potential trouble I started thinking about alternatives. It seems to me it should be possible to merge some of the best features of both open and closed approaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like how open approach fosters contribution. It is encouraging and helps you to refine your content better faster. The problem is that it is difficult to demonstrate value and convert that into sales. The closed approach doesn&amp;apos;t have that problem but contributing won&amp;apos;t be as easy. In addition linking to content isn&amp;apos;t going to work by definition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What if it was possible to take a bit of open, a bit of closed and a bit of Kickstarter, mix it together and end up with something that works for both authors and readers? I imagine it could work as a graduation process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A book idea is identified based on community demand. You as an author pick it up, perform further market study on it and decide to proceed based on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The book will get started in a closed incubator (private GitHub repository for instance) and pre-sales begin. Early adopters will receive access to the content and will be able to contribute towards development of the book.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After a predefined sales threshold is reached (Kickstarter bit) the book content will become available to the public. To make sure book content becomes open despite the sales, a time limit (a year or two?) can be set after which it will become open.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea is that by starting closed you provide incentive for early adopters to buy due to exclusivity. Just being able to contribute towards the development of the book can be a good incentive. You will still get contributions just like in an open model. This requires a certain level of trust, however. What if someone forks the content and runs with it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Kickstarter bit is there to push community towards a common goal. Open content is valuable as it will allow people to access knowledge regardless of their income. It is a shame to see old books become forgotten due to long copyright terms. The time limit is a way to work against this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often good technical books become obsolete in a blink. Having them maintained by the community that uses them actively seems like a good idea to me. After all this is the way open source has proven to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps hitting some kind of a balance between open and closed ways of publishing would pave way for more technical authors. In addition it should help in keeping the content fresh. That is a problem that plagues technical books in particular. Technology tends to be a moving target and having books with better longevity isn&amp;apos;t a bad goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe an alternative model such as this could help to alleviate some of the risks involved. I am certain there are problems I am overlooking. But based on what I&amp;apos;ve seen perhaps it could work. What do you think?&lt;/p&gt;

It was an attempt to change the direction of my career. Being a subcontractor&amp;apos;s subcontractor provides income, sure, but was a dead end for me with no room to grow in an economy that keeps getting tougher. Interestingly the book has garnered a lot of attention and I believe some have found it useful. It has been bit of a disaster economically and it&amp;apos;s hard to imagine I could keep a business like this up for long if something doesn&amp;apos;t change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#why-survivejs-webpack-and-react-was-written-&quot; id=&quot;why-survivejs-webpack-and-react-was-written-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Why SurviveJS - Webpack and React Was Written?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#why-survivejs-webpack-and-react-was-written-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first steps towards the book were taken at the end of January. I happened upon &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/javascript/2014/12/13/did-you-know-webpack-and-react-is-awesome.html&quot;&gt;a blog post about Webpack by Christian Alfoni&lt;/a&gt;. As I had worked with webpack and React earlier I of course couldn&amp;apos;t resist commenting. I even proposed that it would be nice if there was a cookbook about the topic. The comment has been lost to the history but Christian took on my initiative. As a result &lt;a href=&quot;https://christianalfoni.github.io/react-webpack-cookbook/&quot;&gt;react-webpack-cookbook&lt;/a&gt; was born.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked on it together for a few weeks and I started to realize there&amp;apos;s demand. It would have saved me so much time if someone had gathered this information to one place. As a result I poked a contact of mine at a quite known book publisher that pays decent royalties. And so the negotiations began. We negotiated till early April but in the end the publisher wasn&amp;apos;t interested. We failed at writing style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That could have been the end of the story but the opportunity seemed too good to miss. There was a clear demand for a book. Why not to write it? As Christian got busy with work and I was getting increasingly frustrated with my situation I decided to channel the frustration towards something constructive and so I started writing the book. Sometimes you have to go &amp;quot;all in&amp;quot; no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I didn&amp;apos;t feel like going through another round of negotiations with other publishers and I was aware of &lt;a href=&quot;https://leanpub.com/&quot;&gt;Leanpub&lt;/a&gt; I decided to pick them. Early on I agreed with Christian to keep the material open. I was a bit hesitant at first but the approach has shown some of its benefits. I&amp;apos;m still a bit unsure about the financial part, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nice thing about Leanpub is that it allows you to test the market so to speak. I actually released the initial, raw version of the book for free and slowly but surely started to bump up the price as the content matured. That allowed me to gauge interest in the topic. One day Leanpub decided to feature the book and this in turn converted to a nice amount of sales. It always gives you an extra dose of motivation to see people actually appreciate your work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An alternative would have been to start pre-sales through a platform such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kickstarter.com/&quot;&gt;Kickstarter&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately that was not an option for me as a finn given our legislation is against it. There are strict regulations against donations to protect citizens against fraud. Even though understandable it can be a little restricting at times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#where-i-failed-&quot; id=&quot;where-i-failed-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Where I Failed?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#where-i-failed-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having the content &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/survivejs/webpack_react&quot;&gt;out in the open&lt;/a&gt; has resulted in numerous external contributions. I believe this has contributed towards the quality of the book immensely and will continue to do so. But here lies the great conundrum. Why would you pay for something that&amp;apos;s freely available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the book has earned around $1177 excluding Leanpub&amp;apos;s cut (10% + $0.50 per sale). After all the middlemen (PayPal, government, co-op) get their cut and taxes have been paid, that translates to 614 euros. That would be even less if I earned more per year due to the way tax progression works. It would have been more profitable for me to fiddle my thumbs at home and live on social security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The big question is can this situation be changed somehow? I would of course love to keep on developing content. The goofy prefix &lt;code&gt;SurviveJS&lt;/code&gt; implies a series of book. But if I can expect profits like this it just doesn&amp;apos;t make any sense economically. Even though I write because I want to write I still need to make enough to have butter on my bread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot; id=&quot;what-next-&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What Next?&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#what-next-&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The initial plan was that people that feel they get value out of the book would buy the digital version to help fund the maintenance effort and development of new content. Unfortunately this isn&amp;apos;t working out as you can see from the figures above. Sure, the book might generate some income but nowhere enough to make this worth it financially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As far as I can see there are a few options. The easiest option would be just to give up and move onto something more profitable. I had a good run but it wasn&amp;apos;t enough this time. End of story. That would be a silly way to end this, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As donations are illegal that rules out Kickstarter, Patreon and such. I can see these approach have worked for many but unfortunately it&amp;apos;s not possible here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could stop maintaining the open content while putting all the effort to a superior, commercial version. I feel this might result in a lot of bad karma, though. That said I could develop commercial content on top of the free content and sell that perhaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot; id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;a class=&quot;header-anchor-select&quot; href=&quot;#conclusion&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the book has been a success in some ways and exposed people to webpack and React, unfortunately it has failed in the only way that matters in the end. If there&amp;apos;s not a sustainable source of income it is hard to justify the effort financially. I would love to develop more content but if the invisible hand decides it&amp;apos;s not possible, then it&amp;apos;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the end if we want to keep this project alive we&amp;apos;ll need to climb that final, financial hurdle. It is the hardest hurdle for me as I may have to bend on some of my principles. How is it possible to combine open content and business?&lt;/p&gt;
